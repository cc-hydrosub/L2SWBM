L2SWBM CONFIGURATION,,
,,
Notes from developer:,,
"For rolling window, do 6 months or more",,
"For picking NBS component models to input into the L2SWBM, use zeros and ones separated by a space, corresponding to the models below",,
,,
Other Model Options:,,
,,
Outflow Bias - Include a bias term in analyzing outflow estimate inputs,,
Balance Process Error - Include a process error term in the balance equation,,
Model Checks - Run the model such that generated samples include those to check balance closure as well as proper simulation of inputs. Outputs closure summary file,,
Define dH Uncertainty - Set to TRUE if you would like the model to run with a pre-defined uncertainty (standard deviation) value for observed changes in storage,,
,"If FALSE, the model will start with a vague idea as far as how precise the observed changes in storage are",
"dH Uncertainty in mm - If 'Define dH Uncertainty' is TRUE, define it here. Model will assert uncertainty be at least 1 mm. Model will account for rolling window",,

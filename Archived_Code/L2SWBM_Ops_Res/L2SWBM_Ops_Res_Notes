Notes from past e-mails on the L2SWBM_Ops_Res package:

Please do not merge this package with the operational one, as this one has additional precipitation data sets for research purposes.

The new features here can be found in the bottom 3 lines of the config file. 

For precip, evap, and runoff, you may select which lakes receive observational input for those variables, where S = Superior, 
M = Michigan-Huron, E = Erie, and O = Ontario. To remove the variable inputs for a particular lake, just remove its letter 
on the line for its variable. If you want to remove all precipitation inputs for all lakes, for example, you can put "N N N N".
